# Docs UI Visual Review

## Scope
- Desktop: 1440x900
- Mobile: 390x844

  - user: welcome, getting-started, faq
  - dev: index, onboarding, build-and-run
  - ops: index, monitoring

## Findings
- No visual regressions detected across the reviewed pages.
- "Source" toolbar link renders on desktop pages; mobile hides it as expected.
- Code block framing and language labels appear consistently.
- Admonition pills show the compact "note" label and accent border.
