== Why don't I hear sound?
- Ensure SuperCollider is running and listening on the configured host/port.
- Verify the API returns `status: SENT`.
- Check firewall rules for UDP 57120.

== How do I lower latency?
- Run the engine locally (avoid remote UDP paths).
- Keep the tempo consistent; avoid OS-level power saving.

== Can I schedule sequences?
- The DSL supports beat-based sequencing; see development docs for `song { ... }` usage.
