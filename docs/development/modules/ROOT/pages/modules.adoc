= Modules

[NOTE]
====
AUDIT_ME: Module descriptions are based on current files and LINKAGE.md. Confirm as code evolves.

== Core modules
- core: interfaces and sound types (ISoundEngine, SoundEvent, Receipt).
- model: domain data types like BeatTime and TempoBpm.
- dsl: Kotlin builders for composing Song structures.
- playback: scheduler and clock for timed playback.
- engine-supercollider: OSC encoder and SuperCollider engine implementation.
- app-api: Quarkus REST API for /sound/play.

== Dependency rules
- core and model are shared by other modules.
- engine-supercollider should remain behind core interfaces.
- Circular dependencies are not allowed.
