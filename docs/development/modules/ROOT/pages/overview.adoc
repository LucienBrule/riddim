== Purpose
riddim aims to provide a type-safe Kotlin DSL for composing rhythmic structures that can be played by a sound engine.

== Architecture at a glance
- DSL builders produce a Song (beat-timestamped sound events).
- Playback schedules events against a clock.
- Engine implementations send events over OSC (SuperCollider via /dirt/play).
- app-api exposes HTTP endpoints to trigger events.

== Repo layout
- Root Gradle build with module includes in settings.gradle.kts.
- Modules live in modules/ and are compiled independently.
- Docker assets live in deployment/ with a compose file.

== Success metrics
- Green build integrity with clean tests and no warnings.
- Syntactic precision for a type-safe Kotlin DSL.
- Engine reliability with deterministic OSC.
- Architectural clarity with explicit module boundaries.
- Artifact visibility via tracked build outputs.
