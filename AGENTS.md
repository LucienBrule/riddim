## Objective Function
Develop a high-performance, developer-centric music live-coding environment (`riddim`) that bridges the gap between expressive Kotlin DSLs and powerful sound synthesis engines like SuperCollider.

### Success Metrics
- **Green Build Integrity**: Maintain a clean, warning-free, and tested codebase.
- **Syntactic Precision**: Deliver a type-safe Kotlin DSL that enables intuitive musical composition.
- **Engine Reliability**: Ensure low-latency, deterministic OSC communication with the sound backend.
- **Architectural Clarity**: Sustain a modular monorepo structure that separates domain logic from infrastructure.
- **Artifact Visibility**: Ensure all build outputs are tracked, validated, and aggregated for rapid verification.
